      In the United States, facial recognition use in law enforcement is becoming more and more prevalent. As you’ve learned, facial recognition only works when you have a database of faces to compare to. Government agencies have access to a lot of faces. In many states, law enforcement officials are given freedom to use driver’s license photo databases. In other states, mugshot databases are used. Police collect mugshots from people they have arrested, then compare them to local, state, and federal face databases.

      Facial recognition is used by law enforcement in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and other cities in the US. In some cities, like San Francisco, law enforcement has been banned from using face recognition technology. Civil liberty groups have expressed concern, citing the potential for the technology to be used to provide governments with unprecedented power to track individuals.

    <h2>
      The Future of Facial Recognition
    </h2>
    <p>
      Like all powerful technologies, facial recognition has the potential to make serious changes isn our lives. There is proof that this power can be used for good. For example, nonprofits like Thorn, the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and Marinus Analytics to combat human trafficking and other atrocities. This same technology can also aid in creating an advanced police surveillance state, where the government uses the technology to track the whereabouts of every citizen at all times. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to remember that it is not the technology that is inherently good or evil; it all depends on what we use it for. In order to prevent misuse of technologies like facial recognition, we need education and legislation. Please continue to educate yourself on this technology and support facial recognition causes using the resources below.
